# Drag and Drop Interface with React and TypeScript

This project implements a drag-and-drop interface using React, TypeScript, and the React Beautiful DND library. The interface allows users to drag items (represented by cards) between different droppable areas and checks the correctness of the arrangement.

## Features

- Drag and drop cards between different droppable areas.
- Check the correctness of the arrangement of cards in each droppable area.
- Display border colors based on the correctness of the arrangement.
- Limit the number of cards that can be placed in each droppable area.

## Technologies Used

- React: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- TypeScript: A typed superset of JavaScript that compiles to plain JavaScript.
- React Beautiful DND: A library for implementing drag-and-drop functionality in React applications.
- Recoil: A state management library for managing application state in React applications.
